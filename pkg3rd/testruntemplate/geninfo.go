package main

var genInfo = `
This source file was generated from template by "runtemplate"".
The command line is in the comment of ""testruntemplate.go" as "go generate"" command.
I'm Kevin, and the version of the demo is 1.

Following is always useful:
TemplateFile = geninfo.tpl
OutFile      = geninfo.go`
